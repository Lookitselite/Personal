Hello, this project is a set of programs im coding for practice. 
the original code for the card game classes was taken from an intro to programming lecture, but the games (excluding war) are my own. 
currently, blackjack is the only functional game (still missing features: betting, aces high/low, splits, double down, ect.), tex is barely functional, and war does not really count as a game. 
most likely dependent of having python installed.
