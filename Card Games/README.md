Hello, this project is a set of card games im coding for practice. the original code for the classes was taken from an intro to programming lecture, but the games (excluding war) are my own. currently, blackjack is the only functional game (still missing features: betting, aces high/low, splits, double down, ect.), tex is barely functional, and war does not really count as a game. most likely dependent of having python installed.
